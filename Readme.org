Compatibility:

* Possible Dependencies

  `custom', `easymenu', `ess', `ess-compat', `ess-custom',
  `font-lock', `syntax', `widget'.

* Installation

To use without using a package manager:

 - Put the library in a directory in the emacs load path, like ~/.emacs.d
 - Add (require 'ess-smart-underscore) in your ~/.emacs file

This is in emacswiki, so this package can also be installed using el-get.

After installing el-get, Type M-x el-get-install ess-smart-underscore.
* Ess-Smart Underscore Package Information
Smart "_" key: insert =ess-S-assign=, unless:

  1. in string/comment
  2. after a $ (like d$one_two) (toggle with =ess-S-underscore-after-$=)
  3. when the underscore is part of a variable definition previously defined.
     (toggle with `ess-S-underscore-after-defined')
  4. when the underscore is after a "=" or "<-" on the same line.
  5. inside a parenthetical statement () or [].
     (toggle with =ess-S-underscore-when-inside-paren=)
  6. At the beginning of a line.
  7. In a variable that contains underscores already (for example foo_a)
     (toggle with =ess-S-underscore-when-variable-contains-underscores=)
  8. The preceding character is not a tab/space (toggle with
     =ess-S-underscore-when-last-character-is-a-space=.  Not enabled
     by default.)

An exception to #4 is in the following situation:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
a <- b |
#+END_SRC

Pressing an underscore here would produce


#+BEGIN_SRC R
a <- b <-
#+END_SRC

However when in the following situation

#+BEGIN_SRC R
a <- b|
#+END_SRC

Pressing an underscore would produce

#+BEGIN_SRC  R
a <- b_
#+END_SRC

This behavior can be toggled by =ess-S-space-underscore-is-assignment=

If the underscore key is pressed a second time, the assignment
operator is removed and replaced by the underscore.  =ess-S-assign=,
typically " <- ", can be customized.  In ESS modes other than R/S,
an underscore is always inserted.

In addition the ess-smart-underscore attempts to work with noweb-mode

* History

 - 05-Nov-2012 ::  Better handling of noweb. I think it Came from Denis Haine and Martin Maechler. (Matthew L. Fidler)
 - 22-Feb-2012 ::  Support unbalanced sexps. (Matthew L. Fidler)
 - 02-Feb-2012 ::  Took out auto-installing. Most package managers don't want you to do this. (Matthew L. Fidler)
 - 03-Aug-2011 ::  Bug fix for parenthetical statement (Matthew L. Fidler)
 - 20-Jul-2011 ::  Changed to allow underscore instead of assign when inside a parenthetical statement.  (Matthew L. Fidler)
 - 15-Jul-2011 ::  Bug fix for d[d$CMT == 2,"DV"] _ to produce d[d$CMT == 2,"DV"] <-  (Matthew L. Fidler)* Functions
** Interactive Functions

*** ess-smart-underscore
=(ess-smart-underscore)=

Smart "_" key: insert =ess-S-assign=, unless in string/comment.
If the underscore key is pressed a second time, the assignment
operator is removed and replaced by the underscore.  =ess-S-assign=,
typically " <- ", can be customized.  In ESS modes other than R/S,
an underscore is always inserted. 

** Internal Functions
* Variables
** Customizable Variables

*** ess-S-space-underscore-is-assignment
Should underscore produce =ess-S-assign= when a space is right before the cursor.

Used by M-x ess-smart-underscore.

*** ess-S-underscore-after-$
Should underscore produce an underscore if it is an element of a list/data structure?

 Used by M-x ess-smart-underscore.

*** ess-S-underscore-after-<-or-=
Should underscore produce an underscore if it is after a "<-" or "="?

 Used by M-x ess-smart-underscore.

*** ess-S-underscore-after-defined
Should underscore produce an underscore if it is after a variable has been defined?

 Used by M-x ess-smart-underscore.

*** ess-S-underscore-when-inside-paren
Should an underscore be produced instead of =ess-S-assign= when inside a parenthetical expression?

*** ess-S-underscore-when-inside-unbalanced-parenthesis
Should an underscore be produced instead of =ess-S-assign= when inside an unbalanced parenthetical expression such as:

  foo(bar_

This requires =ess-S-underscore-when-inside-paren= to be true.

*** ess-S-underscore-when-last-character-is-a-space
ESS produces an underscore only when the last character is not a space or a tab.

*** ess-S-underscore-when-variable-contains-underscores
Should an underscore be produced instead of =ess-S-assign= when variable already contains an underscore?

** Internal Variables
